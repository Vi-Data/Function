Longest Wait Time Analysis
This Python script analyzes and visualizes the longest wait times per day from a given dataset. The dataset should be in CSV format and contain three columns: 'date', 'time', and 'wait_time'.

Dependencies
To run this script, make sure you have the following libraries and dependencies installed:
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn

The sample csv file contained 'date', 'time', and 'wait_time' columns.
Update the data_file_path variable in the script with the path to your CSV file.
Run the script to process the data and visualize the longest wait times per day.
The script consists of three main functions:

read_data(file_path): Reads the CSV file and returns a DataFrame with the date and time columns properly formatted.
get_longest_wait_times_per_day(df): Processes the DataFrame and returns a new DataFrame containing the date, time, and longest wait time for each day.
plot_longest_wait_times(daily_max_wait_time_with_time): Plots the longest wait times per day using seaborn.
